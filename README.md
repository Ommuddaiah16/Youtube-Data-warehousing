# YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing

Overview:

The YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing project is aimed at developing a solution to access and analyze data from multiple YouTube channels. Utilizing Python scripting, MongoDB, SQL, and Streamlit, this project offers an intuitive interface for users to interact with YouTube data efficiently.

Problem Statement:

The primary challenge addressed in this project is to create a Streamlit application enabling users to retrieve comprehensive data from YouTube channels. The application should facilitate data collection, storage in both MongoDB and SQL databases, and provide seamless data querying and visualization capabilities.
Approach:

1. Streamlit App Development: Set up a Streamlit application to serve as the user interface for accessing and analyzing YouTube data.
2. YouTube API Integration: Connect to the YouTube API to fetch channel and video data, utilizing the Google API client library for Python.
3. Data Storage in MongoDB: Store the retrieved data in a MongoDB database, leveraging its flexibility to handle unstructured and semi-structured data effectively.
4. Data Migration to SQL: Transfer collected data from MongoDB to a SQL database, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, to facilitate structured querying.
5. Querying SQL Database: Utilize SQL queries to extract specific data from the SQL warehouse, including complex operations like joining tables for comprehensive insights.
6. Visualization in Streamlit: Display the queried data in the Streamlit application using its data visualization features, facilitating intuitive analysis.
7. SQL Query Outputs for Streamlit Display:

Results:

This project delivers a user-friendly Streamlit application, leveraging the Google API to gather YouTube channel data. With MongoDB as a data lake and SQL as a data warehouse, users can seamlessly explore and analyze YouTube data through the intuitive interface, enhancing decision-making and insights extraction.
